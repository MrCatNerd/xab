-- TODO LIST --
will be implemented (probably)

- loop over video correctly
- proper hardware acceleration for video decoding
- video frame dropping (can be turned off as an option/flag)
- load default shaders as strings (in build system or smh), so i don't have to have the 'res' directory near the xab executable, i wanna do that in the build system
- custom shaders option cuz why not (in .config/xab or custom path specified as a flag)
- scaling, fitting, centering, tiling and other background stuff
- make a better error system cuz currently its just a mess (and warnings and stuff)
- clean up my bad code lol
- man page


--- IDEA LIST ---
may or may not be implemented

- a framebuffer for each background
- maybe use mpv library for video decoding cuz they use ffmpeg too but they know what they're doing, unlike me
- somehow cache the frames
- find a way to only change 1 monitor/part of the screen without cleaning everything else (maybe save pixmap to a texture?)
- very simple toml config that will become super complicated after a week
- stb_image for normal backgrounds (as a compile option cuz ppl don't like bloat)
- daemon and client thingy (like swww), so i can change the background on the fly and other cool things
- an optional gui (with rust and iced or smh), as a seperate repo, but i think i have to make the daemon thingy first
- tests with a dummy root window and stuff (and delete my garbage build testing thingy)
- slideshow

-- GIT STUFF --
- when things get stable, make a stable branch
- make a CHANGELOG (ill do this when ill release verson 0.1.0... probably)
- use github actions to bulid releases

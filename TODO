-- TODO LIST --
will be implemented (probably)

* general
- VERSION file specifying the version
- --monitor flag before video segfault issue
- 'u_' prefix in shader uniforms
- trace logs
- stb_image/SOIL2 for normal backgrounds (as a compile option cuz ppl don't like bloat)
- max framerate - add a smart fps limiter, and a noraml fps limiter (smart one just takes rendering time into acount or smh like that)
- meson feature selection in meson options, so i can disable features (like multi monitor support)
- make a better error system cuz currently its just a mess
- load default shaders as strings (in build system or smh), so i don't have to have the 'res' directory near the xab executable, i wanna do that in the build system
- custom shaders option cuz why not (in .config/xab or custom path specified as a flag)
- scaling, fitting, centering, tiling and other background stuff
- better clean ups so i can clean up something even though its initalizing
- clean up my bad code lol
- man page
- add a clang format thingy
- ansii logger colors with a meson build option for toggeling it
- try to optimized the hell out of xab
- if there are two videos assigned to the same monitor, play only one of them
- dummy video player or smh
- optimize the hell out of xab and decrease cpu usage as much as i can
- pause rendering: https://github.com/glouw/paperview/issues/7
- remake atom system

* readme
- Contributing
- License in readme (mentions the license)

* mpv video reader
- look into mpv specific video reader bug thingy for specific gpus
- fullscreen monitor (--monitor=-1) doesn't work with libmpv specifically

* xab video reader
- fix my bad ffmpeg reader implementation with a new shiny one
- good frame timing and stuff
- proper hardware acceleration for video decoding
- libavdevice stuff ^
- multithreading
- video frame dropping (can be turned off as an option/flag, on by default)
- find if there a way to not use PBOs, and just write to the gpu texture directly


--- IDEA LIST ---
may or may not be implemented

- add vlc support
- shader pool/cache (for example if i have multiple framebuffers, i can compile res/shaders/framebuffer_vertex.glsl only once)
- find a way to only change 1 monitor/part of the screen without cleaning everything else (maybe save a part of the pixmap to a texture?)
- a very simple toml config that will become super complicated after a week
- daemon and client thingy (like swww), so i can change the background on the fly and other cool things
- an optional gui (with rust and iced or smh), as a seperate repo, but i think i have to make the daemon thingy first
- slideshow for video and images (i think this is already implemented in the libmpv videa reader, but i havn't included it into xab)
- video filters and stuff
- tests with a dummy root window and stuff
- somehow cache the frames? (xab reader)
- error trace with a txt file for errors and stuff
- multithreading

-- GIT STUFF --
- when things get stable, make a stable branch
- make a CHANGELOG (ill do this when ill release verson 0.1.0... probably)
- use github actions to build releases
- git gud

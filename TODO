- proper hardware acceleration for video decoding
- change only 1 screen (multiscreen suppoprt stuff)
- video frame dropping (can be turned off as on option)
- fix up framebuffer implementation
- custom shader option cuz why not (in .config/xab)
- load default shaders as strings (in build system or smh), so i don't have to have the 'res' directory near the xab executable
- loop over video correctly
- make a better error system cuz currently its just a mess (and warnings and stuff)
- clean up my bad code lol
- man page?

proper hardware acceleration for video decoding
video frame dropping (can be turned off as on option)
change only 1 screen (multiscreen suppoprt stuff)
fix up framebuffer implementation
loop over video correctly
make a better error system cuz currently its just a mess (and warnings and stuff)
check why no hw acceleration even though there are available decoders for hw acceleration
